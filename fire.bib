  abstract = {We present landscape simulation results contrasting effects of changing climates on forest vegetation and fire regimes in Yellowstone National Park, USA, by mid-21st century. We simulated potential changes to fire dynamics and forest characteristics under three future climate projections representing a range of potential future conditions using the FireBGCv2 model. Under the future climate scenarios with moderate warming ({$>$}2°C) and moderate increases in precipitation (3–5\%), model simulations resulted in 1.2–4.2 times more burned area, decreases in forest cover (10–44\%), and reductions in basal area (14–60\%). In these same scenarios, lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) decreased in basal area (18–41\%), while Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) basal area increased (21–58\%). Conversely, mild warming ({$<$}2°C) coupled with greater increases in precipitation (12–13\%) suggested an increase in forest cover and basal area by mid-century, with spruce and subalpine fir increasing in abundance. Overall, we found changes in forest tree species compositions were caused by the climate-mediated changes in fire regime (56–315\% increase in annual area burned). Simulated changes in forest composition and fire regime under warming climates portray a landscape that shifts from lodgepole pine to Douglas-fir caused by the interaction between the magnitude and seasonality of future climate changes, by climate-induced changes in the frequency and intensity of wildfires, and by tree species response.},

  abstract = {Wildfire area is predicted to increase with global warming. Empirical statistical models and process-based simulations agree almost universally. The key relationship for this unanimity, observed at multiple spatial and temporal scales, is between drought and fire. Predictive models often focus on ecosystems in which this relationship appears to be particularly strong, such as mesic and arid forests and shrublands with substantial biomass such as chaparral. We examine the drought–fire relationship, specifically the correlations between water-balance deficit and annual area burned, across the full gradient of deficit in the western USA, from temperate rainforest to desert. In the middle of this gradient, conditional on vegetation (fuels), correlations are strong, but outside this range the equivalence hotter and drier equals more fire either breaks down or is contingent on other factors such as previous-year climate. This suggests that the regional drought–fire dynamic will not be stationary in future climate, nor will other more complex contingencies associated with the variation in fire extent. Predictions of future wildfire area therefore need to consider not only vegetation changes, as some dynamic vegetation models now do, but also potential changes in the drought–fire dynamic that will ensue in a warming climate.},

LANDFIRE meets agency and partner needs for comprehensive, integrated data to support landscape-level fire management planning and prioritization, community and firefighter protection, effective resource allocation, and collaboration between agencies and the public. The LANDFIRE data production framework is interdisciplinary, science-based and fully repeatable, and integrates many geospatial technologies including biophysical gradient analyses, remote sensing, vegetation modelling, ecological simulation, and landscape disturbance and successional modelling. LANDFIRE data products are created as 30-m raster grids and are available over the internet at www.landfire.gov, accessed 22 April 2009. The data products are produced at scales that may be useful for prioritizing and planning individual hazardous fuel reduction and ecosystem restoration projects; however, the applicability of data products varies by location and specific use, and products may need to be adjusted by local users.},

  abstract = {A major environmental problem in semi-arid landscapes of western North America is the invasion of native vegetation by cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum L.), an annual Eurasian grass that covers {$>$}40 million ha of range and woodland in the western US. Cheatgrass can be especially problematic after fire—either prescribed fire or wildfire. Although cheatgrass is known to generally thrive in regions of moderate temperatures, dry summers, and reliable winter precipitation, the spatial patterns of postfire cheatgrass invasion are not well characterized at finer spatial scales (e.g., within most individual landscapes). We used boosted regression trees to develop a spatial model of cheatgrass abundance 0 yr to 19 yr postfire in an 8000 km2 semiarid landscape centered on Dinosaur National Monument (Colorado and Utah, USA). Elevation, a deterministic variable, was the strongest single predictor, with higher cheatgrass cover occurring below 1600 meters. Two other contingent variables, fire severity and climatic conditions in the year after the fire, increased the model’s predictive power. The influence of fire severity differed with the scale of analysis. Across the landscape as a whole (including extensive areas at moderate to high elevation), a greater likelihood of high postfire cheatgrass cover (≥10 \%) was associated with lower fire severity. Focusing only on low-elevation areas ({$<$}1600 m), higher fire severity was associated with greater likelihood of high cheatgrass cover. Low precipitation in the year after fire was associated with greater probability of high cheatgrass cover in all areas.},

  abstract = {Climate models project a general decline in western US snowpack throughout the 21st century, but long-term, spatially fine-grained, management-relevant projections of snowpack are not available for Yellowstone National Park. We focus on the implications that future snow declines may have for oversnow vehicle (snowmobile and snowcoach) use because oversnow tourism is critical to the local economy and has been a contentious issue in the park for more than 30 years. Using temperature-indexed snow melt and accumulation equations with temperature and precipitation data from downscaled global climate models, we forecast the number of days that will be suitable for oversnow travel on each Yellowstone road segment during the mid- and late-21st century. The west entrance road was forecast to be the least suitable for oversnow use in the future while the south entrance road was forecast to remain at near historical levels of driveability. The greatest snow losses were forecast for the west entrance road where as little as 29\% of the December–March oversnow season was forecast to be driveable by late century. The climatic conditions that allow oversnow vehicle use in Yellowstone are forecast by our methods to deteriorate significantly in the future. At some point it may be prudent to consider plowing the roads that experience the greatest snow losses.},

  abstract = {Managing climate impacts to natural resources in protected areas can be hampered by lack of monitoring data, poor understanding of natural resource responses to climate, or lack of timely condition assessments that can inform management actions. Here we demonstrate the utility of water balance as a tool for understanding natural resource responses to climate by developing case studies focused on stream flow, vegetation production, and wildfire ignition at Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve (GSDNP), U.S.A. The efficacy of water balance to predict these responses stems from the explicit integration of climate with site conditions that modify the effects of climate. This in turn results in estimates of water availability, water use, and water need that are proximal drivers of aquatic and terrestrial natural resource conditions. The water balance model successfully forecasted stream flow (r2~=~0.69, P~{$<~$}0.001); determined the critical water needs for maintaining annual vegetation production in different vegetation types spanning a large environmental gradient (r2~=~0.18–0.71); and predicted proportion of historic wildfire ignitions in forest (r2~=~0.96–0.99) and non-forest (r2~=~0.96–0.97) vegetation types. Collectively, these case studies demonstrate practical approaches to translate climate data into assessments of natural resource condition that inform long-term planning and near-term strategic actions needed for conservation of protected areas.},
