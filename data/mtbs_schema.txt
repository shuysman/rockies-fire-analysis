Asmnt_Type 	STRING 	

Assessment Type: Which mapping strategy is being used?

"SS" means "Single Scene", or a mapping where just a post-fire image was used.

    Initial
    Extended
    Initial (SS)
    Extended (SS)

BurnBndAc 	INT 	

Burn boundary acreage.
BurnBndLat 	STRING 	

Latitude for burned area boundary centroid.
BurnBndLon 	STRING 	

Longitude for burned area boundary centroid.
Comment 	STRING 	

Comments for delineated perimeter.
dNBR_offst 	INT 	

dNBR offset calculated by the analyst.
dNBR_stdDv 	INT 	

Standard deviation offset calculated by the the analyst.
Event_ID 	STRING 	

Unique identifier for each event (21 characters). Calculated from source data (ICS209, FedFire, etc.) each time an event is created or updated using the state, lat/long coordinates (ig_lat, ig_long). Note that for longitudes less than 100Â° a leading zero is added to maintain 21 characters.
High_T 	INT 	

High threshold: dNBR values above which, or NBR values below which a fire is considered High Severity by the analyst.
Ig_Date 	INT 	

Date of ignition in Unix Epoch Time (the number of milliseconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z).
IncGreen_T 	INT 	

Increased greenness threshold: dNBR values above which, or NBR values below which an area is considered to have Increased greenness by the analyst.
Incid_Name 	STRING 	

Incident Name: common name of the event or "UNNAMED".
Incid_Type 	STRING 	

Type of event:

    Wildfire
    Prescribed Fire
    Wildland Fire Use
    Unknown

irwinID 	STRING 	

Unique, alphanumeric identifier assigned to each incident record in IRWIN or an empty string.
Low_T 	INT 	

Low threshold: dNBR values above which, or NBR values below which a fire is considered Low Severity by the analyst.
Map_ID 	INT 	

Mapping ID (ID for a specific mapping activity).
Map_Prog 	STRING 	

Map Program: which program was this mapping activity completed by? E.g., MTBS'
Mod_T 	INT 	

Moderate threshold: dNBR values above which, or NBR values below which a fire is considered Moderate Severity by the analyst.
NoData_T 	INT 	

Threshold for no data: dNBR values above which, or NBR values below which a fire is considered to represent No Data by the analyst.
Perim_ID 	STRING 	

Scene ID for perimeter scene. Perimeter scenes are scenes selected to help the analyst better identify the fire perimeter. Perimeter scenes are only selected when pre-fire and post-fire scenes are not sufficient to define a perimeter.
Post_ID 	STRING 	

Scene ID for pre-fire scene. If a pre-fire scene was not available at the time of mapping, the mapping analyst uses NBR from the post-fire scene to calculate severity.
Pre_ID 	STRING 	

Scene ID for pre-fire scene or an empty string.
